# odin-recipes
Recipe Project from The Odin Project

This my project to conlude the HTML module in the Odin Project
I demonstrated the &lt;p&gt; tag in the description
I demonstrated the &lt;ul&gt; tag, the &lt;ol&gt; tag, and their &lt;li&gt; children tags to create instructions and ingredient lists

I also showed the &lt;h1&gt;/&lt;h2&gt;/&lt;hx&gt; tags with various headers of description, ingredients, and instructions.

I demonstrated the &lt;a&gt; tag by linking my site together, and having external sites, via the credits of recipes I didn't know myself.

I used the &lt;img&gt; tag to have an image of the various dishes provided.
-I also used both internal and external sources for 'src', with two external refs and 1 internal ref.
