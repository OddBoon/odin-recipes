# odin-recipes
Recipe Project from The Odin Project

This my project to conlude the HTML module in the Odin Project
I demonstrated the <p> tag in the description
I demonstrated the <ul> tag, the <ol> tag, and their <li> children tags to create instructions and ingredient lists

I also showed the <h1>/<h2>/<hx> tags with various headers of description, ingredients, and instructions.

I demonstrated the <a> tag by linking my site together, and having external sites, via the credits of recipes I didn't know myself.

I used the <img> tag to have an image of the various dishes provided.
-I also used both internal and external sources for 'src', with two external refs and 1 internal ref.
