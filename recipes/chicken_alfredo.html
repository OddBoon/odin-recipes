    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken breast</li>
        <li>&lt;1oz of olive oil (or any prefered greaser)</li>
        <li>1oz of lemon juice(optional)</li>
        <li>12oz of Alfredo Sauce(either a jar or the recipe found<a href="./alfredo_sauce.html">here</a>)</li>
        <li>16oz [1 Box of] Fettuccine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the stovetop to med to high heat and bring a pot of water to a rolling boil</li>
        <li>Bring out the chicken breast and dice it into 1/4" cubes.</li>
        <li>Bring another pan to medium heat and drizzle your oil onto it. Put your diced chicken into the pan. Sprinkle your salt/pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the edges are turning golden brown. If your wanting to include lemon juice,
            I would add it before the chicken is browned, but isn't pink, about 2-3 minutes in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pasta is al dante, strain it out with a Colander. Put it back into the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you handmade the sauce, toss it into the pot at this time, if not, pour it into the pan with the chicken to heat up, about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add contents of the pan into the pot and toss it together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plate and serve!
        </li>
    </ol>
